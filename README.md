# Honeyguide

### About

Honeyguide is an app that allows you to effortlessly tour a museum and get information about the pieces you see. Museums using Honeyguide have small speakers by their art pieces. These speakers emit data in an ultrasonic frequency inaudible to humans, but audible to your phone. Honeyguide will load information about the piece onto your phone when you walk up to it, without the hassle of scanning codes or looking up a piece number! Honeyguide was developed by Joseph Antony, Jake Brown, Sherry Chen, Theresa Phan, and Maria Suplee.


### Usage

Start the app and ensure the notification that the app is listening for chirps exists on the top left of your phone. Play one of the .wav files labeled: description1, description2, or description3 while the app is listening for chirps and the app will bring up information about a particular art piece.
